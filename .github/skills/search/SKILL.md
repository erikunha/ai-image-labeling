# Skill: Embed and Search

**Domain:** Setting up and using the semantic/keyword search engine

## When to use this skill

Use when a user wants to:
- Search their classified image collection by description or concept
- Set up the embedding index for the first time
- Troubleshoot search returning wrong or no results
- Understand the difference between keyword and semantic search

## Steps

### 1. Determine which search mode to recommend

Ask the user:
- Do they have an existing `analysis_results.json`? (If not, run analysis first)
- Do they want to search by exact words (keyword) or by concept/meaning (semantic)?
- Which provider are they using? (Affects embedding model available)

For **first-time users**: start with keyword search — zero setup, works immediately.
For **concept queries** ("find photos that look like a kitchen"): guide to semantic setup.

### 2. Keyword search — no setup required

```bash
ai-image-labeling search --keyword "your term" --output ./output
```

Fields searched: `shortDescription`, `fullDescription`, `elements`, `extractedText`.
Ranked by match count. Case-insensitive. Literal substring match only (no stemming yet).

### 3. Semantic search — requires embedding step

```bash
# Step 1: generate embeddings (one-time)
ai-image-labeling --input ./photos --output ./output --skip-analysis --embed

# Step 2: search
ai-image-labeling search --query "your concept query" --output ./output
```

If the user is on Anthropic without an OpenAI key:
- Either add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` (cheapest embedding option)
- Or switch embedding to `--provider google` (free tier) or `--provider ollama` (local, free)

### 4. Validate results

Check for common failure modes:
- **Empty results**: index file missing → re-run `--embed`
- **Wrong results**: check `fullDescription` field is populated in `analysis_results.json`
- **Provider mismatch error**: old index built with different provider dimensions → re-run `--embed`

### 5. Advise on known limitations

Tell the user:
- Keyword search is O(n) at >10K images — H13 (SQLite FTS5) will fix this
- Index is rebuilt from scratch on every `--embed` run — incremental updates coming in H14
- No metadata filters yet (`--filter-category`, etc.) — coming in H13
- See ROADMAP.md H13–H14 for the planned improvements

## Technical context (for implementation questions)

- Embedding vectors stored in `analysis_embeddings.index.json` as JSON float64 arrays
- Cosine similarity via `cosineSimilarity()` in `src/search/index.ts`
- `generateEmbeddings()` in `src/analyzer/embeddings.ts` handles provider routing
- `searchSemantic()` and `searchKeyword()` in `src/search/query.ts`
- `buildEmbeddingText()` builds: `"category: shortDescription. Elements: el1, el2. fullDescription"`
